### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`StageManager`**](#stageManager-component): Keeps track of the App's current stage.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

StageManager (shown in the diagram above) is accessible by the Logic component for checking and updating the app's current stage.

Each of the other four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface.

Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component),
as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Interactions Inside the Ui Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CourseListPanel`, `CombinedPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiComponent` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `MainWindow` includes a `DisplayPanel`, which has three different states it can toggle between
1. The `SplashPanel` for the opening splash window
2. The `CombinedPanel` that displays the student list and a course list sidebar
3. The `CoursePanel` that displays the course list (this is otherwise known as the `home` screen)

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI components are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute the commands.
* keeps a reference to the `StageManager` to update the `UI` with its corresponding display panel.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Course` and `Student` objects residing in the `Model`.
* depends on some classes in the `Storage` component, as it updates to and retrieves user inputs from the `Storage`.

The typical flow of a user's interaction with the UI is as follows.

![Standard action flow of Ui Component](images/UiActivityDiagram.png)

During startup, the MainWindow will be displayed and all components loaded into it, with a splash screen showing before
entering the course list display.

For user commands, there are two unique commands which cause separate actions to be performed:
* `exit`, which immediately closes the application.
* `help`, which displays the help window pop-up.

After each command (assuming the application is not closed), the UI will check with the StageManager to see which stage it is set to,
(either StageManager.HOME or StageManager.SELECTED_COURSE) and displays the corresponding panel
(CourseListPanel for `HOME` and CombinedPanel for `SELECTED_COURSE`).

This action flow will loop until the user decides to exit the application.
During the application's runtime, the user may  also exit the application through the MainWindow's top panel buttons (File -> Exit)
or the red '**x**' button on the top right of the application screen.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram bellow ilustrates the interactions within the `Logic` componenet, using `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteCourseSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CodeSphereParser` object to parse the user command. This in turns creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCourseCommandParser`) which will parse the relevant arguments in the user input.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an item).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCourseCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CodeSphereParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CodeSphereParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes throw a ParseException if there are any errors with the arguments.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the app data i.e., all `Course` and `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCourseList` and `UniqueStudentList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Course` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Course>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected course's' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)
![Interactions Inside the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CourseList data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* can save user inputs and retrieve them in the future
* inherits from both `CourseListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The Storage component builds upon the AB-3 Storage component by adding an InputStorage, which encapsulates the concept of
storing user inputs.
These user inputs are stored in chronological order and are accessed through the StorageManager.
All user inputs will be stored in the InputStorage, and will also contain the data whether the input was accepted as a
valid command or not. Handling of this input validity will be done by the UI component.


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.codesphere.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation of Home Commands**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features on the Home Page are implemented.

### Add a course
#### About the add course feature
The `add` command on the home page allows users to add a course/class that they teach as a TA. For example,
a user can use `add CS2103T` to add the course CS2103T onto the home page for their management.

#### Implementation Details
The `add` command here is supported by the `AddCourseCommand` and `AddCourseCommandParser`. Users are able to add a
non-duplicate course to the existing course list.

#### Parsing user input
1. The user inputs `add` and provides a `c/COURSENAME` that they teach.
2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `AddCourseCommandParser`.
3. The `AddCourseCommandParser` parses the user input and checks if the prefix `c/` is present and there is only one such prefix present. If not, a `ParseException` is thrown.
4. `AddCourseCommandParser` will then call `ParserUtil#parseCourseName()` to verify if the input `COURSENAME` is valid. If invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown.
5. An `AddCourseCommand` will then be created with the respective input.

#### Command Execution
1. The `LogicManager` executes the `AddCourseCommand`.
2. The `AddCourseCommand` calls `Model#hasCourse()` to check for duplicate courses. If duplicate present, a `CommandException` is thrown.
3. `Model#addCourse()` will then be called to add the input course to the course list.

#### Displaying of result
1. Lastly, the `AddCourseCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
   The GUI will also be updated accordingly as it calls the `filteredCourseList` which was updated during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` mechanism in the home page works:
![AddCourseSequenceDiagram](images/AddCourseSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summaries what happens when a user executes the `add` command:
![AddCourseActivityDiagram](images/AddCourseActivityDiagram.png)


### Edit a course
#### About the edit course feature
The `edit` command on the home page allows users to edit the course name a course/class that they teach as a TA. For example,
a user can use `edit 1 c/CS2103T` to edit the course at the first index of the displayed list to have course name CS2103T.

#### Implementation Details
The `add` command here is supported by the `EditCourseCommand` and `EditCourseCommandParser`. Users are able to edit
a course as long as the new course name is not a duplicate in the existing course list.

#### Parsing user input
1. The user inputs `edit` and provides the `INDEX` of the course to edit, and the `c/NEW_COURSENAME` of the existing course.
2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `EditCourseCommandParser`.
3. The `EditCourseCommandParesr` parses the user input and checks if the input `INDEX` is valid by calling `ParserUtil#parseIndex()`. If invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown.
4. `EditCourseCommandParesr` then checks if the prefix `c/` is present and there is only one such prefix present. If not, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
5. `EditCourseCommandParser` will then call `ParserUtil#parseCourseName` to verify if the input `NEW_COURSENAME` is valid. If invalid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
6. An `EditCourseDescriptor` is then created with the `NEW_COURSENAME`.
7. A check will be done to see if there was a change in the course name. If not, a `ParseException` is thrown.
8. An `EditCourseCommand` is then created with the respective index and `EditCourseDescriptor`.

#### Command Execution
1. The `LogicManager` executes the `EditCourseCommand`.
2. The `EditCourseCommand` creates an `editedCourse` with the new course name.
3. `EditCourseCommand` then calls `Model#hasCourse()` to check for duplicate courses. If duplicate present, a `CommandException` is thrown.
4. `Model#setCourse()` will then be called to replace the existing course with the `editedCourse`.
5. `Model#updateFilteredList()` will then be called to update the filtered course list.

#### Displaying of result
1. Lastly, the `EditCourseCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
   The GUI will also be updated accordingly as it calls the `filteredCourseList` which was updated during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit` mechanism in the home page works:
![EditCourseSequenceDiagram](images/EditCourseSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `edit` command:
![EditCourseActivityDiagram](images/EditCourseActivityDiagram.png)


### Delete a course
#### About the delete course feature
The `delete` command on the home page allows users to delete an existing course in the displayed course list. For example,
a user can use `delete 1` to delete the course at the first index of the displayed list.

#### Implementation Details
The `delete` command here is supported by the `DeleteCourseCommand` and `DeleteCourseCommandParser`. Users are able to delete
a course as long as the index is valid.

#### Parsing user input
1. The user inputs `delete` and provides the `INDEX` of the existing course to delete.
2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `DeleteCourseCommandParser`.
3. The `DeleteCourseCommandParser` parses the user input and checks if the input `INDEX` is valid by calling `ParserUtil#parseIndex()`. If invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown.
4. A `DeleteCourseCommand` is then created with the respective index.

#### Command Execution
1. The `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteCourseCommand`.
2. The `DeleteCourseCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredCourseList()` to get an unmodifiable view of the filtered course list to determine the course to delete based on the input INDEX.
3. `Model#deleteCourse()` will then be called to delete the target course from the displayed course list.
4. `Model#resetFilteredList()` will then be called to update the filtered course list.

#### Displaying of result
1. Lastly, the `DeleteCourseCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
   The GUI will also be updated accordingly as it calls the `filteredCourseList` which was updated during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` mechanism in the home page works:
![DeleteCourseSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteCourseSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `delete` command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation of Course Commands**

### Add a student
After selecting a `Course` from the `UniqueCourseList`,  `Student` objects can be added into the `UniqueStudentList` of the `Course`.  Compulsory fields for the `AddCommand` include `Name`, `Email` and a performance `Tag`. The optional `Remark` and `PendingQuestion` fields cannot be added using the `AddCommand`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the adding mechanism works. We will skip to where the `AddCommand#execute()` method is called.

* Step 1. The `AddCommand` object’s `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. `StageManager` is used to obtain the current `Course` selected.
* Step 3. A check for duplicates in the `UniqueStudentList` of the current `Course` is done. If the new `Student` to be added already exists, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 4. The new `Student` is added into the `UniqueStudentList` of the current `Course`.


### Edit a student
`Student` objects are stored in their respective Course’s `UniqueStudentList`. The details (name, email, remark, pending question, tag) of a student in a course can be edited by changing the fields of the `Student` object.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing mechanism is carried out on a `Student` in a course. We will skip to where the `EditCommand#execute()` method is called.

* Step 1. The `EditCommand` object’s `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The index provided is checked to be within bounds of the course’s student list. If it is not, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. A new `Student` object, `editedStudent` is created with the edited inputs.
* Step 4. A check for duplicates in the current course is done. If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 5. The original student in the current course’s student list is replaced with `editedStudent`.


### Sort student list for a selected course feature

#### About the sort student list for a selected course feature

The sort student list feature allows users to sort the student list for a selected course in the order specified as the `SORT_CRITERIA`, which can either be `NAME` or `TAG`.

#### Implementation details

The sort mechanism is facilitated mainly by the `SortCommand`, `SortCommandParser` and `SortCriteria`.

#### Parsing user input
1. The user inputs the `sort` command and specifies the sort criteria after the sort command prefix, in the format of `sort s/SORT_CRITERIA` (eg. `sort s/tag` or `sort s/name).
2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `SortCommandParser`.
3. The `SortCommandParser` then parses the user input and first checks whether the sort prefix `/s` is present. It also checks that there are no prefix duplicates.
   At this stage, if the sort prefix is not present or if the input contains multiple sort prefixes, `ParseException` would be thrown.
4. Next, `ParsetUtil#parseSortCriteria()` is called to check the validity of the input `SORT_CRITERIA` input.
   At this stage, `ParseException` would be thrown if the `SORT_CRITERIA` specified is invalid.
5. The `SortCommandParser` then creates the `SortCommand` based on the processed inputs.

#### Command execution
1. The `LogicManager` executes the `SortCommand`.
2. The `SortCommand` object’s `execute()` method is called. `SortCommand` first gets the singleton instance of `StageManager` through `StageManager#getInstance()`, then gets the current selected `Course` object through `StageManager#getSelectedCourse()`.
3. Finally, `SortCommand` calls `Course#sortStudentsBy()` to sort the student list based on the `SORT_CRITERIA` specified, and updates the displayed student list accordingly.

#### Displaying of result
1. `SortCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and returns it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
2. The GUI is updated following the changes in the student list and the display of the student list is updated accordingly.

Below is a sequence diagram that shows how the `sort` mechanism works:
![SortCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summaries what happens when a user executes the `sort` command:
![SortCommandActivityDiagram](images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Command syntax**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `sort s/SORT_CRITERIA`.
    - **Pros:** Simple command with minimal fields, where only a single sort prefix is needed.
    - **Cons:** Users do not have a choice for sorting by ascending or descending order. When the `SORT_CRITERIA` is `NAME`, student names are displayed in ascending order, with names starting with ‘A’ at the top of the list. For `TAG`, students with performance tag `GOOD` are at the top of the list.

- **Alternative 2:** `sort s/SORT_CRITERIA o/SORT_ORDER`.
    - **Pros:** Provides users with more options which allows for greater flexibility.
    - **Cons:** Users are required to use a second `SORT_ORDER` prefix `/o` in addition to the `SORT_CRITERIA` prefix `s/`, which can slow down the use of the command.

- **Alternative 3:** `sort s/SORT_CRITERIA [o/desc]`, where `[o/desc]` is optional.
    - **Pros:** Retains the flexibility provided by Alternative 2, but also the conciseness of Alternative 1 should they wish to leave the `SORT_ORDER` empty.
    - **Cons:** Users who are not aware of the optional `[o/desc]` field may not use it.

**Aspect: Which fields should be considered as a valid sort criteria**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `NAME` and `TAG` are the only two valid criteria.
    - **Pros:** Users can easily remember the valid criteria as there are only two options. `NAME` and `TAG` are also the two criteria that are likely to be the most useful criteria to sort students by.
    - **Cons:** Users do not have the choice to sort by other criteria.

- **Alternative 2:** All student fields are considered to be a valid.
    - **Pros:** Users have the ability to sort by any field.
    - **Cons:** Allowing sorting by the other student fields add very little value to the users. Sorting by `NAME` can be useful for administrative purposes, while sorting by `TAG` can be useful in helping the user identify the group of weaker students. However, it is unlikely that users will need to see the student list sorted by`EMAIL`, `PENDING_QUESTION` or `REMARK` fields.

### Add a pending question to a student from a selected course

#### About the adding a pending question feature

The `pq` command allows the user to add a pending question to a student based on the index input from the user.
For example, a user could add a pending question such as `Tutorial 1 Question 10` to the second student from the list by using `pq 2 pq/Tutorial 1 Question 10`.
It's important to note that adding a pending question to a student is not cumulative. In other words, adding another pending question to a student with an existing pending question will replace the old pending question with the new one.

#### Implementation Details
The `pq` command here is supported by the `PendingQuestionCommand` and `PendingQuestionCommandParser`. Users are able to add
a pending question to a student as long as the index provided is valid.

#### Parsing user input
1. The user inputs the `pq` command, provides the index of the targeted student, and follows it by the pending question using the prefix `pq`.
2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `PendingQuestionCommandParser`.
3. The `PendingQuestionCommandParser` parses the user input and checks whether the input is the correct format. For example, the index must be valid and the input after `pq` cannot be empty.
<br>
If the conditions are not met, a `ParseException` is thrown.

#### Command execution
1. The `LogicManager` executes the `PendingQuestionCommand`.
2. `StageManager` is used to retrieve the current `Course` by calling `StageManager#getCurrentCourse()`.
3. The `PendingQuestionCommand` calls the `Course#getFilteredStudentList()` to obtain a list of `Student` belonging to the course object and identify the targeted `Student` from the list.
4. A check for index from the user input will be done.If the index is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
5. A new `Student` object is created by passing in the `PendingQuestion` instance to the Student constructor.
6. Update the newly created Student instance to replace the old Student instance.

#### Displaying of result
1. The `PendingQuestionCommand` will create a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the LogicManager to complete the command execution. The GUI will also be updated accordingly as it calls the `filteredStudentList` which was updated during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `pq` mechanism works:
![PqSequenceDiagram](images/PendingQuestionSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `pq` command:
![PqActivityDiagram](images/PendingQuestionCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Finding a student from a selected course

#### About the find feature
The `find` command allows users to search for relevant students based on details of the specified criteria in their input. For example, a user could use `find n/KEYWORDS` to find a students names which contain or match that with the keywords.
They can use keywords in `NAME`, `EMAIL`, `TAG`, `REMARK` to find students with words or phrases containing all of the words mentioned in keywords.
Do note that only 1 criterion can be used at one time.

#### Implementation Details
The partial class diagram of the `find` command can be seen. What is important to note here is the use of a `Predicate` class and the `updateFilteredStudentList` method which utilises the predicate class.

There are multiple different predicate classes created to accurately filter through the student list. Below, is the example usage scenario and how the `find` mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input
1. The user inputs the `find` command and provide the input with the attribute of the student contact and its respective prefix (eg. `n/NAME` or `r/REMARK`) in which the user wants to find the student.
2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `FindCommandParser`.
3. The `FindCommandParser` parses the user inputs and checks for whether the input is the correct format. The input needs to contain only 1 prefix and the keywords cannot be empty.
If the conditions are not met a `ParseException` is thrown.
4. If the format is valid, a predicate class matching the prefix is created. For example, for `NAME`, the predicate object created is `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. This class takes in the values of the keywords and the object is passed into the newly created `FindCommand` object.

#### Command execution
1. The `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`.
2. The `FindCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the filtered person list based on predicate class.
3. The `FindCommand` then calls the `Model#getFilteredPersonList()#size()` to get the size of the person list. The size will correspond to the number of persons listed.

#### Displaying of result
1. The `FindCommand` will create a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution. The GUI will also be updated accordingly as it calls the `filteredStudentList` which was updated during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` mechanism works:

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `pq` command:

![FindCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How should multiple keywords be considered**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Whether all keywords are contained in any order in the specified criteria
  - **Pros:** Provides a more specific and refined search.
  - **Cons:** May result in fewer matches if all keywords are not present.
- **Alternative 2:** At least 1 keyword is contained
  - **Pros:** Increases the likelihood of finding matches.
  - **Cons:** Might lead to less precise results if only one keyword is present.

**Aspect: How should the filtered list be filtered based on the keywords**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** As long as keywords are contained inside
  - **Pros:** More flexible and tolerant to variations in keyword placement.
  - **Cons:** May include irrelevant matches if keywords are part of larger words.
- **Alternative 2:** Instead of contains, do a complete word match
  - **Pros:** Provides more precise matching by requiring complete word matches.
  - **Cons:** May exclude relevant matches if keywords are not complete words.

These considerations and alternatives should be weighed based on the specific requirements and expected user experience in your application.

### Input History

#### About the input history feature
CodeSphere allows all the user's previously entered text (referred to as 'input') to be saved and retrieved at a later date.
Retrieval of this input history is through the 'UP' and 'DOWN' keys on the keyboard.

#### Handling user input
When the user inputs text through the `CommandBox`, the program will see if the input returns a successful command
or throws an exception (which causes the program to display an error such as 'Unknown command').
These inputs will be stored in `InputHistory` as a text alongside an indicator of whether the text was a valid input or not.

`InputHistory` contains a pointer that will keep track of which command in the history is being displayed so that
it can display the relevant 'previous' and 'next' command when required.
Entering any input will cause the pointer in `InputHistory` to be reset to display the latest command upon the next retrieval.

#### Handling key presses
When an 'UP' arrow key is registered: The `InputHistory` will display the command that was entered previously (chronologically).
If the command history is at its earliest command, the earliest command will continue to be displayed.

When an 'DOWN' arrow key is registered: The `InputHistory` will display the command that was entered next (chronologically).
If the command history is at its latest command, the `CommandBox` will be set to blank.

#### Displaying of result
When an input is displayed, it will be displayed on the `CommandBox` and overwrite any text previously typed into it.
If the input is recognised as invalid, the text displayed will be coloured red, or otherwise it will be displayed in the default white colour.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect:** Whether we should store and display all user inputs or just valid commands

- *Currently:* All user inputs are stored and displayed, whether invalid or valid commands.
- *Alternative 1:* Only valid user inputs will be stored. Invalid commands will be ignored by `InputHistory`.

**Pros and Cons:**
- *Currently:*
    - **Pros:**
      - Users can easily view and edit any invalid commands previously entered.
    - **Cons:**
      - May result in a larger input history especially if many invalid commands were typed by the user,
      which impedes the user from easily finding the history of valid command inputs.

- *Alternative 1:*
    - **Pros:**
      - Allows the users to view all valid inputs quickly, which acts as a 'command log' to track all their
      previously entered commands.
    - **Cons:**
      - Users are unable to edit or view previously entered inputs, requiring them to re-type their entire command if
      they initially inputted it wrongly

       Expected: All students with remark containing `20` are shown.

    4. Test case: `find r/cs 20`<br>
       Expected: All students with remark containing both `cs` and `20`, in any order, are shown.

    5. Incorrect find commands to try: `find`, `find n/` `find n/John r/homework`, etc.<br>
       Expected: No student filtered. Error details shown in the error message.

2. Finding a student while the student list is being filtered.

    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the current page is the home page using the `course` command. Filter the students using the `find` command.

    2. Test case: `find n/Jason`<br>
       Expected: If the student list was initially filtered with `find r/homework` before `find n/Jason`, all students with their remark containing `homework` and name containing `Jason` are shown.

    3. Incorrect find commands to try: `find`, `find n/` `find n/John r/homework`, etc.<br>
       Expected: No student filtered. Error details shown in the error message.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
We found that the difficulty level of the project was slightly more challenging compared to CS2103T's Individual Project (iP).
While the workload was similar to the iP, there was an additional level of team management required (such as division of roles and
resolving code conflicts) that made meeting target milestones slightly more challenging. 

Furthermore, while AB3 focused on managing a single entity type of `Person` in an address book,
CodeSphere deals with multiple entity types that are linked to each other, namely `Course` and `Student`.

### Challenges faced
One challenge we faced early on was a 'repetitive' command usage, as the simultaneous handling of two classes
`Course` and `Student` meant that a lot of commands were duplicated
(e.g. `AddCourse` vs `AddStudent`, `EditCourse` vs `EditStudent` ) .
This was eventually resolved through utilising a StageManager
(inspired by the above acknowledged project [Waddle](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w11-4.github.io/tp/)),
which handles the logic of which class was currently viewed as 'active'; the application will now determine the appropriate action to take
for a command (i.e. `add` will now perform `addStudent` or `addCourse` depending on which stage is active).

### Effort required
- **Program architecture:** CodeSphere built upon the existing project structure of AB3, adding in many additional commands and
    structures (`course`, `pending questions`, `filters`) to support our application.
    Through constant iterative upgrades and feedback, we managed to build and encapsulate our 
    designs into the application that CodeSphere is today.
- **UI / UX improvements:** While working on improving our application architecture and logic, we also simultaneously
  made significant improvements to the graphical user interface (GUI), such as intuitive colour coding schemes and logos,
  as well as the general user experience (UX) such as accessing the user's input history.
- **Bug Testing and Fixing:** During the development of our application, we ensured constant developer testing by
    writing and editing test cases for new features / changed implementations of any code that we wrote. Our goal for
  unit and integration testing was to aim for >70% code coverage (as we do not test for UI classes).  
  After development of our application was finished, we also released an early version to be bug tested in
  Practical Exam's dry run (PE-D) by external reviewers, and then worked hard to find and fix any issues that were raised during
  the PE-D.
- **Documentation:** Throughout our entire project, we have been carefully documenting our changes to be able to provide 
    comprehensive and concise documentation for both users (*User Guide*) and other developers (*Developer Guide*) that may be viewing our application design.
    This included providing relevant screenshots, diagrams and various other supporting text / images to guide the reader 
    to better understand the project and answer any questions they may have. We have also ensured that the project website 
    and our individual portfolios have been kept updated.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Select from Course Page

While in the course selection page, users are unable to immediately reselect another course by utilising the `select` command. 

While this was originally not intended for our product as the typical workflow for users would be returning to the course page through `home` and re-selecting from there, we recognise that users may wish to immediately reselect
a course while viewing a separate course. 

We plan to make the `select` command work regardless of which page that the user is currently viewing.

### Parsing with / character in edit and find command

The command prefix for `edit` and `find` is unable to properly differentiate when a `/` symbol is used with the character prior to it resembling a prefix character.

For example, `edit 1 r/e/b` should be interpreted as '`edit` index `1` with the `remark` `e/b`' but is currently taken as '`edit` index `1` with the new `email` `/b`'. 
Another example is when using the `find` command for students. `find r/homework answer is e/d` will result in a duplicate prefix command error.

We plan to change the parser of these commands to prioritize the firstmost prefix. This adjustment will resolve the issue for the `find` command. 
For `edit`, we intend to introduce more specific prefixes to allow greater versatility for users editing the fields. For instance, we could change `e/` to `email!/`. The likelihood of such a word being used for the other criteria is minimal and would effectively solve the problem.

### More specific command errors

Our application is currently unable to recognise invalid prefix commands that are written behind a valid prefix command -- instead it produces an 'invalid format' error for the valid prefix command.

For example, `add c/cs2100 t/good` gives the error "Course code should contain a two or three letter prefix, a four digit course code, and an optional one letter suffix", when it should recognise that "t/" should not be included and produce an appropriate error message.

We plan to make the error message accurately reflect the invalid prefix command, such like (in the example above) displaying "Add course command should not contain the prefix `t/`".

### UI Colour Scheme

Our application currently follows a similar 'dark theme' colour scheme as was set by AB3, as we found it to be the most 
aesthetically pleasing to view. However, we recognise that different users may want to customise or view the application 
differently. We would thus like to introduce more colour schemes that may also benefit certain user groups (etc. making our labels dichromatism-friendly).

### UI Font Size

Our application currently has a set default font type and sizing, which may not be readable for all users. In the future,
we plan to introduce an adjustable font types/sizing so that users can adjust it to meet their own individual needs.

### Changing Tag Sets

The tags for a `Student` in our application are set to `GOOD`, `AVERAGE` and `POOR`, and work as a performance indicator.
However, such tags may be too subjective for users if they wish to categorise their students according to a more objective
tag scheme, but the tags are currently unable to be changed to anything other than these 3 values. We plan to allow users to
define their own tags (as well as corresponding colour schemes), so that tags are customisable according to the user's unique situation.
