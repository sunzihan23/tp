CodeSphere is a **desktop contact management app, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface [(CLI)](#glossary)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface [(GUI)](#glossary).
It is an app targeted at Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing (SoC) to help them better manage administration of their students.

We understand that as a TA, you might often find it difficult to keep track of all your students' progress and administrative matters.
And that is why we have developed CodeSphere for you. With CodeSphere, you will have a simple and effect way to manage your students, allowing for customised support to keep tabs on each student.

It doesn't matter if you are a new or experienced TA, with CodeSphere, you can easily:
* Add a course that you teach.
* Then, add students into that course.

And to find out more about what else CodeSphere can do for you, continue to read the rest of this all-encompassing user guide.

## **Quick Start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer. If you do not have Java `11`, follow [this](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) installation guide.
2. Download the latest `codesphere.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your CodeSphere application.
4. Open your command terminal, then `cd` into the _home folder_.
5. Use the `java -jar CodeSphere.jar` command to run the CodeSphere application.
6. The CodeSphere home page, similar to the [GUI](#glossary) displayed below, should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

   ![Ui](images/HomePage.png)

7. In the command box, type in a command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute the command. For example, typing `help` then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will show the help window. Below are some other example commands you can try:
* `select 1` :  Selects the first course from the list of courses currently displayed on the home page. The [GUI](#glossary) changes to show the list of students in the selected course.
* `add c/CS1101S` : Adds a course named `CS1101S` to the course list.
* `edit 1 c/CS1231S` : Updates the course name of the first course displayed with the new course name specified.
* `delete 3` :
  1. If you are currently on the home page, it deletes the third course shown in the current list.
  2. If you are currently on the course page, it deletes the third student shown in the current list.
* `exit` : Exits the application.

For a more detailed walk-through on how to use CodeSphere to start managing your students as a TA, head to [Tutorial for Beginners](#tutorial-for-beginners).
Else, if you prefer exploring the application on your own, head to [Features](#features) below for more details on each command.

## **Tutorial for Beginners**
*If you are not a beginner, or would like to explore CodeSphere on your own,
feel free to skip this tutorial or jump to whichever portion you require.*

### Tutorial Contents
1. [**Adding a course**](#tutorial-adding-a-course)
2. [**Adding students**](#tutorial-adding-students)
3. [**Adding remarks / pending questions**](#tutorial-adding-remarks--pending-questions)

**Let's explore CodeSphere's features through the eyes of a teaching assistant.**
When you open up the application for the first time, after a brief splash screen of the CodeSphere logo,
you will see CodeSphere's `home` page, with 6 pre-populated sample courses.

![Ui](images/tutorial/Tutorial_HomePage.png)

At the top of the application, there is an underlined portion that we will refer to as the *Command Line*.
This is where your commands are typed, and they are confirmed by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard.
Below the Command Line is the *Result Box* (which is the outlined box),
which will tell you the outcome of any commands that you have entered.
Lastly, underneath that is the *Display Panel*, which will be updated after each command is entered.


### Tutorial: Adding a course

*(For demonstration purposes, we'll be using `CS2101` as our chosen course.
Feel free to replace this with any other course.)*

Let's begin by adding our course into the home page with the command `add c/CS2101`.
After pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, you will see a message informing you that there is a *New course added: CS2101* in the *Result Box* and the course `CS2101` will appear at the bottom of the list.
You will notice that an item number is displayed beside the course name (note the **7.** beside *CS2101* in the image), as well as some other information being displayed for each course, like the total number of students and total number of pending questions.

![CS1101S in Homepage](images/tutorial/AddCS2101.png)

### Tutorial: Adding students

Next, let us add some students into our `CS2101` course.
To do that, we will first need to navigate into our `CS2101` course by using the command `select 7`, which selects the seventh course in the course list.

This will bring you to the course page for `CS2101` and your application should now change to look like the image below.
In the course page, the course list is now being displayed in the left column, while the right column that will be used to display students added to the selected course is currently empty because students have not been added into `CS2101`.

*Tip: You can always refer to the Result Box to see whether the command you entered has been successful.*

![Empty CS1101S](images/tutorial/SelectCS2101.png)

The student list for `CS2101` is currently empty, so let's add a few students into the list with the following commands:
*(Remember to press 'Enter' after each command)*
`add n/John Tan e/e0123456@u.nus.edu t/good`
`add n/Mary Lim e/e1234567@u.nus.edu t/average`
`add n/David Lee e/e2345678@u.nus.edu t/poor`

>:information_source: Note: When creating students, you must always include their name (`n/`), email (`e/`) and performance tag (`t/`).

![Filled CS1101S](images/tutorial/course_students.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Tutorial: Adding remarks / pending questions

Lastly, let's take a look at how we can add remarks or pending questions for a student.
To start, try adding the remark "Will be 15 minutes late for tutorial" to *John Tan* who is the first student in the list, 
by typing `remark 1 r/Will be 15 minutes late for tutorial`.

Similarly, let's note down Mary's pending question about "Tutorial 2 Question 4" through the command `pq 2 pq/Tutorial 2 Question 4`.

Your page should now be updated with the remark and pending question added to John and Mary respectively.

![Add Remark and PQ](images/tutorial/remark_pq.png)

And with that, you have now successfully created your first course, added a few students, and even noted down some extra information for your students.

>:bulb: As a final tip, you can use the directional ***UP*** and ***DOWN*** keys on your keyboard to access the commands that
you have previously entered.

Now that you know how CodeSphere works, feel free to explore some other features that have been specially curated for you to manage your students with ease, such as
[listing out all students with pending questions](#list-all-pending-questions-list),
[sorting the students by different criteria](#sorting-all-students-sort) or even
[finding students with certain keywords in selected field](#finding-a-student-find).

## **Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

### **Miscellaneous**

### Saving the data

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CodeSphere home folder.

## **Known Issues**

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen,
   the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the application before running the application again.
